                <p class="about-text">
                    I’m a Computer Science Engineering student at ABESEC, currently specializing in Data Science. My academic journey has given me a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, machine learning, and full-stack development. Beyond the classroom, I actively pursue hands-on projects that solve real-world problems using modern technologies. Whether it's building websites, experimenting with AI tools, or working on college assignments with a practical twist, I constantly seek out opportunities to turn ideas into working solutions.

                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I serve as the Technical Head of the Unstop Igniters Club (ABESEC Chapter), where I lead and mentor peers on tech initiatives, hackathons, and project-building challenges. This role has helped me develop leadership skills and a collaborative mindset, while also staying at the forefront of new technologies and platforms. My involvement has also deepened my understanding of tech-driven innovation and how it can be used to empower student communities.

                    Outside of academics and club responsibilities, I enjoy gaming and playing football—both of which fuel my competitive spirit and help me maintain a balanced lifestyle. My long-term goal is to become a Software Development Engineer at a top-tier tech company, where I can contribute to impactful, large-scale projects while continuously learning and growing. I’m passionate about building a career that combines creativity, technical skill, and a drive to make a difference through technology.
